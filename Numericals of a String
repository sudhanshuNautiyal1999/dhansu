Q1>
You are given an input string.

For each symbol in the string if it's the first character occurence, replace it with a '1', else replace it with the amount of times you've already seen it...

But will your code be performant enough?

Examples:
input   =  "Hello, World!"
result  =  "1112111121311"

input   =  "aaaaaaaaaaaa"
result  =  "123456789101112"

def numericals(s):
    dictio = {}
    t = ""
    for i in s:
        dictio[i] = dictio.get(i,0) + 1 
        t += str(dictio[i])
    return t
